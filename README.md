# Seacrest
Seacrest Engine. Inspired by [Hazel](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel), except it uses Win32 & Direct3D 11 thanks to [Daddy Chili's Hardware 3D Series](https://github.com/planetchili/hw3d)!

You can clone the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/Rachelyoubish/Seacrest`.

If you decide to clone and generate the projects, there may be a few auto-generated settings missing still.

Such as:
- Setting the local debugging directory to the output directory.
- And setting the shaders output directory to Sandbox's output directory.
